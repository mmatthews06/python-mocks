# python-mocks
Some example Python unit test mocks

This code has been tested with Python 3.7, though should be backwards compatible to 3.6 and maybe 3.5.

## Usage:
To run the tests, do the following:

1. Clone the repository:
 ```{bash}
 git clone https://github.com/mmatthews06/python-mocks.git
 ```
2. Change into the source directory:
 ```{bash}
 cd python-mocks/src
 ```
3. Run the unit tests
 ```{bash}
 python -m unittest discover
 ```

You may also want to run the app:
```{bash}
python src/main.py --foo hello --bar bye -r -p ltra
```
